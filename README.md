Clean Architecture
------
In this project I am using Clean Architecture approach to make separation of concern that could be match into SOLID Principle. It will give :
- Test your data layer, domain layer and also presentation layer on a different test cases, then you can always update or change it based on your needs and also based on your problem on each layers
- Maintainable 
- Isolate business logic without disrupting UI
- Can implement any of android arch pattern on presentation layer without making any changes on business logic(usecase) every time change arch pattern
- Team easy manage their own arch pattern on each presentation layer based on what their needs and problems without changes business logic(usecase)
- Avoid refactor code in the feature and engineers can be focus implement feature

How to use it?
------
- Clone this project using `git clone [url]`
- build the project by using `./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug`
- You can run the Unit test by using `./gradlew clean test`
